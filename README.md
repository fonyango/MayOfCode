#### Day 04: Wednesday, 5th May 2021

I was able to work on 3 coding excercises by writing simple funtions that can:

- find the dot product of arrays element-wise.
- count vowels in a string.
- remove punctuations from a sentence.

In each case, I explored different ways and tricks in finding the solutions.

#### Day 03: Tuesday, 4th May 2021

I completed 4 coding questions by writing python programs that can do the following:

- determines if there is a distinct pair of numbers in a sequence whose
product is odd.
- takes a sequence of numbers and determines
if all the numbers are different from each other (that is, they are distinct)
- use Pythonâ€™s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90].
- using only the randint function,
implement your own version of the shuffle function.

It was so exciting to successfully find a solution to the exercises.
