#### Day 12: Thursday, 13th May 2021

On this day I was extremely tired and unable to do anything on this challenge. May be a good time to rest, but the challenge continues.

#### Day 11: Wednesday, 12th May 2021

After a very busy day, I was able to do some mathematical operations using python. I wrote a program that can calculate employees total weekly pay, given different parameters for calculation. 

The program takes in employee's hourly wage, employee's total regular hours and employee's total overtime hours to calculate the total weekly pay.

#### Day 10: Tuesday, 11th May 2021

This day is about calculations! I was able to create two programs that perform the following:

__1. a program to assign grades to students at the end of the year.__

- This program asks the user to input student number, test marks and tutorial marks. 
- It the computes the average marks. If the student scores below 40% the student it not permiitted to do examination. The programs exits without performing further steps.
- If the students scores above 40%, it prompts the user to input examination marks
- The program calculates the final marks such that test mark and tutorial mark accounts for 25% each while examination marks accounts for 50%.
- Finally the program assigns grades to the student based on their final marks.

__2. a simple calculator with a menu__

- This program prompts the user to perform arithmetic operations based on the provided menu assigned to integers 0 - 4 (inclusive).
- If the user selects any of the provided menu except 0, the program prompts the user to input two numbers on which the selected operation will be performed.
- If the user selects 0, the program exits.
- However, if the user enters an invalid integer, the program ignores and displays the menu.

#### Day 09: Monday, 10th May 2021

I'm so happy to get into a new week and still passionate about this coding challenge. Today I created a program that simulates a calculator with the following details:

- uses the console as the exclusive input and output device.
- each input to the calculator can be done on a separate line.
- outputs to the Python console what would be displayed on your calculator.

___

#### Day 08: Sunday, 9th May 2021

After brainstorming for over 1 hour, I was able to write a program that can take a positive integer greater than 2 as
input and write out the number of times one must repeatedly divide this
number by 2 before getting a value less than 2.

I'm so excited that finally I was able to successfully write it.

#### Day 07: Saturday, 8th May 2021

This excercise involved working with lambda functions and rewriting the functions as named fucntions. I was able to write functions as both lambda and named fucntions that can do the following:

- calculates the square of x.
- calculates the square root of the sum of squares of x and y.
- calculates the average of parameters of any number.
- returns a string of unique values from an input string.
___
#### Day 06: Friday, 7th May 2021

I did not manage to work on any excerise. The day was a bit busy for me. However, I was able to read the resource book on Error Handling.
___

#### Day 05: Thursday, 6th May 2021

I explored the use of while loop and break to writing some programs that do the following:

- repeatedly prompts the user for an integer. If the integer is even, print the integer. If the integer is odd, don’t print anything. Exit the program if the user enters the integer 99.
- prompts the user to enter integers until the user enters a negative integer. The negative integer should be discarded, and you should print the average of
all the previously entered integers.

___

#### Day 04: Wednesday, 5th May 2021

I was able to work on 3 coding excercises by writing simple funtions that can:

- find the dot product of arrays element-wise.
- count vowels in a string.
- remove punctuations from a sentence.

In each case, I explored different ways and tricks in finding the solutions.

___

#### Day 03: Tuesday, 4th May 2021

I completed 4 coding questions by writing python programs that can do the following:

- determines if there is a distinct pair of numbers in a sequence whose
product is odd.
- takes a sequence of numbers and determines
if all the numbers are different from each other (that is, they are distinct)
- use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90].
- using only the randint function,
implement your own version of the shuffle function.

It was so exciting to successfully find a solution to the exercises.

___

#### Day 02: Monday, 3rd May 2021

I was excited to get to the second day by working on some 4 exercises. It involved creating short python functions that can peform the following:

- use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [ a , b , c , ..., z ], but without having to type all 26 such
characters literally.
- get parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
range with values 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, −2, −4, −6, −8?
- get parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
range with values 50, 60, 70, 80?
- use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256].

A good day indeed. Comprehension syntax is very convinient.

#### Day 01: Sunday, 2nd May 2021

This was the first day of the challenge. I decided to pick [Data Strutures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118290279) as my resource material for the challenge. This is one of the materials I will be using to study as I work on the challenge.

I started by writing basic funtions capable of doing the following:

- takes two integer values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some
integer i, and False otherwise.
- takes an integer value and returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. 
- takes a positive integer n and returns the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n.
- takes a positive integer k and returns a list of the squares of all the positive even integers smaller than k.
- takes a positive integer k and returns a dictionary of all positive odd integers smaller than k as keys and squares of 
the positive odd integers smaller than k as values.
