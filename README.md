# May of Code

This is my challenge to code each day of the Month of May 2021.

**Commitment:** To code daily through the month of May 2021.

*Start Date:* 2nd May 2021

*End Date:* 31 May 2021

**Goals:** 
- Code daily
- Build my portfolio
- Improve my git command line skills
- Develop my understanding and conceptualization of Python Data Structures and Algorithms
       
**Resource:**  [Data Strutures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118290279)

#### Day 05: Thursday, 6th May 2021

I explored the use of while loop and break to writing some programs that do the following:

- repeatedly prompts the user for an integer. If the integer is even, print the integer. If the integer is odd, don’t print anything. Exit the program if the user enters the integer 99.
- prompts the user to enter integers until the user enters a negative integer. The negative integer should be discarded, and you should print the average of
all the previously entered integers.

#### Day 04: Wednesday, 5th May 2021

I was able to work on 3 coding excercises by writing simple funtions that can:

- find the dot product of arrays element-wise.
- count vowels in a string.
- remove punctuations from a sentence.

In each case, I explored different ways and tricks in finding the solutions.

#### Day 03: Tuesday, 4th May 2021

I completed 4 coding questions by writing python programs that can do the following:

- determines if there is a distinct pair of numbers in a sequence whose
product is odd.
- takes a sequence of numbers and determines
if all the numbers are different from each other (that is, they are distinct)
- use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90].
- using only the randint function,
implement your own version of the shuffle function.

It was so exciting to successfully find a solution to the exercises.

#### Day 02: Monday, 3rd May 2021

I was excited to get to the second day by working on some 4 exercises. It involved creating short python functions that can peform the following:

- use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [ a , b , c , ..., z ], but without having to type all 26 such
characters literally.
- get parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
range with values 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, −2, −4, −6, −8?
- get parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
range with values 50, 60, 70, 80?
- use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce
the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256].

A good day indeed. Comprehension syntax is very convinient.

#### Day 01: Sunday, 2nd May 2021

This was the first day of the challenge. I decided to pick [Data Strutures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118290279) as my resource material for the challenge. This is one of the materials I will be using to study as I work on the challenge.

I started by writing basic funtions capable of doing the following:

- takes two integer values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some
integer i, and False otherwise.
- takes an integer value and returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. 
- takes a positive integer n and returns the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n.
- takes a positive integer k and returns a list of the squares of all the positive even integers smaller than k.
- takes a positive integer k and returns a dictionary of all positive odd integers smaller than k as keys and squares of 
the positive odd integers smaller than k as values.
