# -- DAY FIVE ---

'''
1. Write a program which repeatedly prompts the user for an integer. If the integer is even, print the integer. If the
integer is odd, donâ€™t print anything. Exit the program if the user enters the integer 99.
'''
while True:
    x = int(input(" Enter an integer:"))
    if x%2==0:
        print(x)
    elif x==99:
        break

''' 
2. Some programs ask the user to input a variable number of data entries, and finally to enter a specific character
or string (called a sentinel) which signifies that there are no more entries. For example, you could be asked to
enter your PIN followed by a hash (#). The hash is the sentinel which indicates that you have finished entering
your PIN.
Write a program which averages positive integers. Your program should prompt the user to enter integers until
the user enters a negative integer. The negative integer should be discarded, and you should print the average of
all the previously entered integers.
'''

ints = []
while True:
    x = int(input("Enter a positive integer:"))
    avg = 0
    if x > 0:
        ints.append(x)
    else:
        avg = sum(ints)/len(ints)
        print("The input list is {0} and the average is {1}".format(ints,avg))
